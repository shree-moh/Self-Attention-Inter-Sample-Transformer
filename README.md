Software Defect Prediction (SDP) efficiently allocates resources by identifying defect-prone modules, and recent research increasingly leverages deep learning techniques in this domain. This study investigates the applicability of SAINT, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for tabular data, in SDP. Through comprehensive comparisons with XGBoost and Random Forest, considering key metrics like PD, PF, Balance, and FIR, SAINT consistently outperforms its counterparts, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing defect prediction accuracy. The findings contribute valuable insights into the role of deep learning techniques in SDP, emphasizing SAINT's potential to advance defect prediction methodologies in practical software development scenarios.
